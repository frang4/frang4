# Hi 👋🏻

My name is Francisco, or `frang4` and I am a Computer Engineer passioned about computer science and more precisely _cybersecurity_. I am a curious learner and the idea behind this blog/notes is to share some of my work, feel free to contact me.

## Experience

Key highlights:
* Hands-on experience in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and exploit development, gained through both professional roles and active participation in CTFs.
* Technical expertise in DevSecOps and secure infrastructure design.
* Solid knowledge of risk treatment strategies and compliance with standards such as ISO/IEC 27001.

My background combines offensive and defensive security skills with a strategic mindset, allowing me to work cross-functionally with development and operations teams to embed security from design through deployment.

## Certifications
* `CPTS` - Certified Penetration Tester Specialist path completed
* **CWEE** - Certified Web Exploitation Expert 40% path completed
* **CBBH** - Certified Bug Bounty Hunter 85% path completed

## Projects
- **[Alquilapp](https://github.com/frang4/Alquilapp)** 🚗📱 - Alquilapp is a project for "Software Engineering" course in the Computer Engineering career. It's an hourly car rental mobile and web app showing available cars on a list and map, with sections for administrators and supervisors.
- **[ObservAR](https://github.com/laureanobruno/ObservAR)** 📷🤖 - The "ObservAR" project aims to create a robust system utilizing a robotic arm for precise image recognition and object tracking, geared towards applications in automation, medical assistance, and security. It integrates various modules for detection, tracking, and power management, facilitating communication between EDU-CIAA and ESP32-CAM boards for stable object tracking using a specialized dataset.
- **[VR Car with ESP32 CAM](https://github.com/tpII/2023-A1-VR-ESP32CAM)** 🕹️🚗 - The project involves creating an autonomous vehicle controlled via keyboard, featuring dual cameras on a robotic arm, streaming to VR goggles. Head movements detected by the goggles move the arm, enhancing the immersive driving experience. It integrates MQTT, webserver technologies, ESP32 modules, and custom PCBs.
- **[CDyM-LDR](https://github.com/frang4/CDyM-LDR)**: A comprehensive toolkit for creating and managing digital circuits and microcontroller projects.
